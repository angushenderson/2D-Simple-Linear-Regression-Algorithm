# 2D-Simple-Linear-Regression-Algorithm
Simple linear regression algorithm that works in 2D for simple Machine Learning
The project simply reads in data from a CSV file and then processes it before calculatig a line of best fit and displaying it in a 2D scatter plot. There are also functions for calculating where a point will lie on the line.
Going into the project I wanted to use as few modules as possible for the logic side of things, and in the end I only used random for randomly splitting the data set into training and testing data, and numpy for preping the data for graphical representation which I made using matplotlib.pyplot. 
I also tried to comment for the first time and went a bit overboard but hey, it is what is is and the file is like 3 times as long as a result. 
To run use the run function in the code. I have provided a CSV file with the code as the project was created as a Physics project so feel free to test that or use your own. It might be easier to re-run each individual function to fit your needs rather than the run function, so if you fo just run the functions in the order you see them in the run fuction, just change the parameters to suit your needs.
In the future i'm going to try and do a multiple dimentional linear regression algorithm but we'll see how that goes...
